# TODO

## Github Actions

- WIP: CI (bundle install, rubocop, rspec)

## Devise

- Logout (top right of application layout so its in all views)

## POST Constraint

[constraint POST /visits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27852655/can-i-accept-post-request-only-from-a-domain-name) by domain.

## Visits Index View: Custom date range

Date range picker to select any date range (need to calc min/max dates of available data, maybe need to limit to X rows for sanity?)

## Data

Add `pathname` column populated by client side js: `window.location.pathname` for shorter for display in UI (compared to `url`).

WIP Add custom validation to `Visit` model to not record user agents like bot, headless, etc.

How long user has been on page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/147636/best-way-to-detect-when-a-user-leaves-a-web-page

## Design

- Icon
